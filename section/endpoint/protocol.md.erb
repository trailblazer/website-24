<%= h2 "Protocol" %>

Whenever you need an operation *"around"* your actual business operation, to add authentication, policy checks, finding models, or other steps before or after your domain code, you want to start using a _protocol_ endpoint. We usually call those simply _endpoint_.

<%= h3 "Overview" %>

A protocol endpoint is defined per *use case*, which usually corresponds to a particular controller action and operation. In this example, an `Update` operation is embraced by its endpoint. You may add arbitrary steps to the endpoint, such as authentication, authorization or data filtering that is unrelated to your business domain.

<%= image_tag "endpoint-update.png" %>

Here, two exemplary steps `authenticate` and `policy` are placed before the actual business operation `Memo::Operation::Update`. Also note how both "protocol steps" lead to their own terminus. However, the layout of the endpoint is completely up to you.

Endpoints define a fixed set of possible outcomes: besides `success` and `failure` there might be additional, more fine-grained termini like `not_found` or even `credit_card_invalid`. It's the job of your team to decide which generic, reusable termini to introduce.

The key idea of a fixed set of outcomes is a fixed set of handlers. You implement the handlers for each terminus once, and override those in specific cases per controller or controller action. In other words, `not_found` renders a 404 error automatically, but you can customize the rendering in a `success` outcome manually.

<%= h4 "Protocol" %>

Endpoints can be used anywhere, in controllers, tests, background jobs, or wherever you need to invoke an operation. This example showcases a typical Rails controller using an operation `Memo::Operation::Create` along with our self-tailored protocol. The latter might look like so.

<%= code "protocol" %>

The `Protocol`, for obvious reasons, needs to be an `Activity` subclass like `Railway` or `FastTrack`.

<%= image_tag "endpoint-protocol-railway.png" %>

The steps involved, the termini exposed, all that is up to the designer. Only one step named `:domain_activity` is mandatory as this step gets replaced with the actual business operation.

<%= h4 "Defining" %>

Use the controller method `::endpoint` to compile an actual endpoint with your `Protocol` and a concrete operation.

<%= code "endpoint-controller", zoom: "define" %>

This is done on the class level so it's compiled and stored once.

<%= h4 "Invocation" %>

To run the protocol with your operation, use `#invoke`. This part is (almost) identical to when running an [operation without a protocol](#endpoint-controller-invoke).

<%= code "endpoint-controller", zoom: "create" %>

With `protocol: true`, the invocation logic will grab the endpoint you created earlier. Check the `#wtf?` trace to understand what happens here.

<%= image_tag "protocol-wtf" %>

As planned, the business operation is run as one step of the protocol.

Nevertheless, this example is very verbose. You can move many options onto the controller level. This is discussed in the following sections.

<%= h3 "Layout" %>

One main reasons to use protocols is a fixed set of termini, which allows you to create default matchers to handle outcomes generically. This reduces application code in your controllers and saves developers from having to think about possible outcomes.

<%= h4 "Terminus" %>

When creating a protocol for a component of your application, you can use any feature of the [Wiring API](/2.1/docs/operation/index.html#operation-wiring-api) - in the end, a protocol is just another "operation".

<%= code "protocol-terminus", collapse: "skip" %>

The above example protocol exposes five termini. Three extra termini are added using [`#terminus`](/2.1/docs/operation/index.html#operation-wiring-api-terminus) to Railway's `success` and `failure` tuple.

To re-route the `failure` output of the `authenticate` step, the Wiring API is leveraged and connects it straight to the new terminus `not_authenticated`.

<%= image_tag "endpoint-protocol-termini" %>

Five termini to rule them all.

1. `success` obviously indicates everything went fine.
2. `failure` informs the caller of a validation error.
3. `not_found` could be terminated on when a model wasn't found.
4. If the `current_user` couldn't be computed, due to invalid credentials, the `not_authenticated` terminus is hit.
5. Any kind of policy breach could be routed to `not_authorized`.

Now, exposing this kind of layout is only helpful if you actually handle each case in a specific way. For a better understanding, here's an example default matcher.



<%= h3 "Configuration" %>

Any [configuration directive](#endpoint-controller-configuration) from the controller layer can be used in combination with a protocol. Anyhow, we do have additional options to fine-tune the compilation of your protocol endpoints.

<%= h4 "options" %>

Use the `options` directive to default options used when defining endpoints on the controller level.

<%= code "controller-options", zoom: "endpoint" %>

With the above setting, you can skip the `:protocol` option.

<%= code "controller-options", zoom: "define" %>

Note that you can still manually override the class-wide option when defining the endpoint.

<%= h4 "fast_track_to_railway" %>

If you're not interested in handling your operation's `pass_fast` and `fail_fast` termination separately, you can use the `:fast_track_to_railway` shortcut in `options` to wire the two fast track termini to their railway friends.

<%= code "controller-fast-track", zoom: "endpoint", collapse: "skip" %>

This will result in a flow diagram similar to this.

<%= image_tag "endpoint-fast-track-rw.png" %>

Here, the distinction between `failure` and `fail_fast` gets lost after the endpoint has been run. In most scenarios, this is desired, as this mimics querying the result object via `result.success?`.

In some cases you might want to deal with a `fail_fast` or `pass_fast` termination of your operation. Simply override the option when defining the specific endpoint.

<%= code "controller-fast-track-false", zoom: "define" %>

Your endpoint now needs to define those two additional termini, so they can be properly connected.
