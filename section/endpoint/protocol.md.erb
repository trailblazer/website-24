<%= h2 "Protocol" %>

Whenever you need an operation *"around"* your actual business operation, to add authentication, policy checks, finding models, or other steps before or after your domain code, you want to start using a _protocol_ endpoint. We usually call those simply _endpoint_.

<%= h3 "Overview" %>

A protocol endpoint is defined per *use case*, which usually corresponds to a particular controller action and operation. In this example, an `Update` operation is embraced by its endpoint. You may add arbitrary steps to the endpoint, such as authentication, authorization or data filtering that is unrelated to your business domain.

<%= image_tag "endpoint-update.png" %>

Here, two exemplary steps `authenticate` and `policy` are placed before the actual business operation `Memo::Operation::Update`. Also note how both "protocol steps" lead to their own terminus. However, the layout of the endpoint is completely up to you.

Endpoints define a fixed set of possible outcomes: besides `success` and `failure` there might be additional, more fine-grained termini like `not_found` or even `credit_card_invalid`. It's the job of your team to decide which generic, reusable termini to introduce.

The key idea of a fixed set of outcomes is a fixed set of handlers. You implement the handlers for each terminus once, and override those in specific cases per controller or controller action. In other words, `not_found` renders a 404 error automatically, but you can customize the rendering in a `success` outcome manually.

<%= h4 "Protocol" %>

Endpoints can be used anywhere, in controllers, tests, background jobs, or wherever you need to invoke an operation. This example showcases a typical Rails controllers using an operation `Memo::Operation::Create` along with our self-tailored protocol. The latter might look like so.

<%= code "protocol" %>

The `Protocol`, for obvious reasons, needs to be an `Activity` subclass like `Railway` or `FastTrack`. The steps involved, the termini exposed, all that is up to the designer. Only one step named `:domain_activity` is mandatory as this step gets replaced with the actual business operation.

<%= h4 "Defining" %>

Use the controller method `::endpoint` to compile an actual endpoint with your `Protocol` and a concrete operation.

<%= code "endpoint-controller", zoom: "define" %>

This is done on the class level so it's compiled and stored once.

<%= h4 "Invocation" %>

To run the protocol with your operation, use `#invoke`. This part is (almost) identical to when running an [operation without a protocol](#endpoint-controller-invoke).

<%= code "endpoint-controller", zoom: "create" %>

With `protocol: true`, the invocation logic will grab the endpoint you created earlier. Check the `#wtf?` trace to understand what happens here.

<%= image_tag "protocol-wtf" %>

As planned, the business operation is run as one step of the protocol.

Nevertheless, this example is very verbose. You can move many options onto the controller level. This is discussed in the following sections.
